# Plaid Link Integration Summary

## What was implemented:

### Backend Changes:
1. **Updated existing banking routes** (`backend/src/routes/banking.ts`):
   - Added support for both `/api/banking/exchange-token` and `/api/banking/exchange` endpoints
   - Added error handling for database operations
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing API calls

2. **No changes to server.ts** - The existing server already had the PlaidService integrated

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Updated BankingDashboard component** (`frontend/src/components/banking/banking-dashboard.tsx`):
   - Replaced with new implementation using `react-plaid-link`
   - Added proper state management for Plaid Link flow
   - Integrated with existing API client
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Shows message when no accounts are connected

2. **Updated PlaidLinkComponent** (`frontend/src/components/data/plaid-link.tsx`):
   - Replaced custom SDK loading with `react-plaid-link` library
   - Simplified the integration with proper hooks
   - Added proper error handling and state management

3. **Added react-plaid-link dependency** to the frontend package.json

### Key Features:
- **Banking Page** (`http://localhost:3000/banking`): 
  - "Connect Account" button that opens Plaid Link
  - Shows connected accounts with balances
  - Displays recent transactions
  - Proper loading and error states

- **Data Page** (`http://localhost:3000/data`):
  - "Connect Bank Accounts" section with Plaid Link integration
  - Production connection and demo options
  - Status feedback for connection attempts

- **Dashboard Page** (`http://localhost:3000/`):
  - Shows banking summary data
  - Displays connected account information

## How it works:

1. **Link Token Creation**: 
   - Frontend calls `/api/banking/link-token` to get a link token
   - Backend uses PlaidService to create token with sandbox environment

2. **Plaid Link Flow**:
   - User clicks "Connect Account" button
   - react-plaid-link opens Plaid Link modal
   - User enters sandbox credentials (user_good / pass_good)
   - Plaid returns public_token to frontend

3. **Token Exchange**:
   - Frontend calls `/api/banking/exchange-token` with public_token
   - Backend exchanges public_token for access_token
   - Backend fetches account information and stores it
   - Frontend refreshes to show connected accounts

4. **Data Display**:
   - Banking dashboard shows connected accounts
   - Recent transactions are displayed
   - Account balances are shown with proper formatting

## Testing:
- Use sandbox credentials: `user_good` / `pass_good`
- Institution: "First Platypus Bank" (ins_109508)
- All endpoints work with the regular server (`npm run dev`)

## Environment Variables Required:
- Backend: `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`, `PLAID_ENV=sandbox`
- Frontend: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SECRET`

The integration is now complete and working with the main application!
